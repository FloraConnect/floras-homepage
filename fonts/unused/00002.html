<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"How would you commit suicice?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">Quick and without much pain. So Probably jumping off a bridge or using a gun to shoot myself in the head. Or blowing myself up in the garage with some gas cans. Who knows, just want it short and painless.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Got any kinks?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">Yeah, i got a lot. I would say they are pretty harmless compared to what i was into when i discovered kinks. Nowdays i'm kind of weird when it comes to kinks but they definetly don't hurt anyone. They are just a bit odd lol.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Ever had sex?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">I did have sex yes. I was 14 at the time and i know that was too young. But in my country it's legal so i gave a fuck. I had sex with a girl that was in the other class of my school and we met when i was one week alone at home. It was pretty fun but still, i think i shouldn't have done it.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Ever got sexually harrased online?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">Yeah, back then when i still had a twitter account with like 1,5k followers there where many dudes wanting asspics and sending me dickpics without asking me. It was a weird time. I pretty much ignored it but now that i think about it, it kinda makes me wanna vomit.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Do you own Sextoys?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">Yes i do, i won't say wich ones exactly cuz i do not think thats important but yes i do.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Is there NSFW art of your Fursona?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">Yes there is. There is a looooot of NSFW art of my fursona. Many of those are made without my consent tho from weird people on furry porn websites.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">"Any new kinks that you never thought you would ever like?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">YEAH...i kinda (a lot) love the idea of someone sucking their own dick and cumming in their own mouth. I know that seems random or weird but i don't care. I freaking love it.</h2>
