<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"Why do you like the 2000s so much?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">The 2000s where pretty simple in terms of Software and Tech. For example updates for console games where around 12mb, while nowdays they are 12gb. And operating systems used to look amazing and colourful. Not boring and blank like nowdays. It was just a better time in my opinion.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"Why did you join the Furry Fandom?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">Back then it gave me a lot of mental support to get through some rough times. Now that i am better i am still in it due to the many nice people in it.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"Whats your opinion on VrChat?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">It's a cool game and stuff. But i don't see the reason for me to play it. Since i get sick with VR and don't know what to do in it anyway.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"Whats your favorite childhood memory?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">Probably when i was sitting in my room while it snowed outside playing with my old Nintendo ds. I was playing mario kart ds that night. I will never forget about this calm moment. It just felt amazing sitting inside in the warm room knowing christmas is almost there.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"What was your first Gamertag?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">My first and oldest gamertag was "Mr.Noway". I have no idea how i came up with that name but i kept it for around 6 years before finally deciding to stay with the name "FluffyFlora".</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 146, 32)">"How did you came up with your Fursona?"</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(1, 82, 17)">I simply just didnt wanted to have a fursona that is too colourful. It's a meme that most furries have a blue huskie or wolf as their fursona. I just wanted to be different by choosing my colours and the patter. I wanted to stand out and i think i did the right thing.</h2>
